# introduction
Iterate with JavaScript Do...While Loops

It is called a Do...while loop because of its behaver behavior
when the condition fails on the first time it

# body

The Do...while is similar to other loops but different from other loops by how it behaves when the condition fails on the first check.

 it will first do one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what, and then continue to run the loop while the specified condition evaluates to true.

# conclusion
i still need to do more examples on it and learn more on it, i also need to redo all of the loops with different conditions.
